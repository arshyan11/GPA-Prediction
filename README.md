# GPA-Prediction
1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Problem Statement: 
Academic performance in higher educa on is influenced by various socio-economic and 
demographic factors, as well as access to resources and learning materials. At NUST, ensuring an 
equitable learning experience for all students is a priority. However, there is limited data-driven 
insight into how these factors impact first-semester GPA. 
This study aims to predict the first-semester GPA of NUST students using machine learning 
models based on socio-economic and demographic factors. By collec ng data from peers and 
conduc ng both descrip ve and predic ve analyses, we seek to iden fy poten al dispari es 
and areas for improvement. The insights gained will assist HR professionals, educators, and 
psychologists in developing targeted strategies to support students and enhance academic 
equity at NUST. 
1.2. Objec ves: 
The primary objectives of this study are to: 
• Identify key socio-economic and demographic factors that influence academic 
performance in higher education. 
• Analyze the extent to which each factor impacts academic success. 
• Explore interrelations among these factors and their combined effects. 
• Provide recommendations for educators and policymakers to improve student 
outcomes through targeted interventions. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1. Introduc on 
The literature review chapter contains up-to-date information on the influence of 
socioeconomic conditions on the performance of students, and there is intensive 
participation in employing Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to uncover the 
relationships. In interrogating a range of sources, from academic journals and subject matter 
experts' opinions in this chapter, an effort is made to understand a holistic view of the 
socioeconomic determinants, predictive models, and their application in education. 
Employing such linkages can assist us in enhancing initiatives that enable academic equity 
and significant student success measures at NUST. 
2.2. Literature review for feature selec on 
In a 2020 study, Smith described in “Socioeconomic Status and Academic Outcomes in 
Developing Countries” how socioeconomic status determine academic outcomes. 
Socioeconomic variables are major determinants of differences in academic outcomes based 
on their analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a positive association between high levels of 
education of parents, sound finances, as well as good academic achievements. As it is 
apparent, socioeconomic factor is treated as an important influence on educational 
performance, especially in a multi-dimensional educational context, as in NUST. 
Brown (2019) did a detailed research on the topic, “How Personal Factors Influence 
Academic Behavior and GPA in African American STEM Students”. His investigation indicates 
that these factors, which are strongly dominated by socioeconomic conditions, are strong 
predictors of academic success. The economic and social factors, which have been 
emphasized in the study, create a great impact on the psychological condition of the students 
and the regular life that they lead, which directly correlates to their grades. 
Based on the work by Johnson and White (2018), entitled, “High School GPAs and ACT Scores 
as Predictors of College Completion”, it was reported that these academic measures often 
reveal socioeconomic differences thus a correlation between past academic success and 
economic status and the potential for pursuing undergraduate studies. 
2.3. Literature Review for Algorithms 
Asif et al., (2021) further analyzed this in his study “Predicting Students’ Academic 
Performance Using Linear Regression”. It was demonstrated that Linear Regression models 
are able to make the accurate forecasting of students' academic performance, while taking 
into account various socioeconomic factors. The researchers strung together analysis points 
like attendance records, past academic successes, and family earnings to demonstrate how 
much the socioeconomic background impacts students’ overall GPA. The researchers 
highlighted that linear models provide a way to determine the correlation between 
socioeconomic background and the grades of the students. 
Luan (2020) used the report “Regularized Regression for Student Grade Prediction” to apply 
ridge regression in the prediction of student grades amidst correlated socioeconomic 
variables. The result demonstrated that the use of regularization methods results in different 
improvements of the prediction results during the analysis of interconnected variables, which 
are taken from the background of socioeconomic status and education. The results 
demonstrated that Ridge Regression is very unique as a tool for understanding how the 
complicated relationships between students' socioeconomic status, resources, and academic 
outcomes are. 
El-Bakry and Ismail (2019) explored in their study, "Predicting Student Performance Using 
Lasso Regression and Random Forest: A Comparative Study", the comparative effectiveness 
of Lasso regression and Random Forest models in identifying key socioeconomic predictors 
of academic success. Their research demonstrated Lasso's ability to enhance feature 
selection by isolating the most influential socioeconomic factors while maintaining predictive 
accuracy. This study highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate modeling 
techniques when analyzing the multifaceted impact of socioeconomic status on education. 
In their study, “Predicting Student Academic Performance Using Elastic Net Regression” 
Hossain et al. (2021) proposed a new idea in forecasting students' academic achievement by 
applying the Elastic Net regression to study the socioeconomic factors and their effect on 
Performance. They showed improved model efficiency in student grade prediction by 
including diverse socioeconomic indicators such as parental occupation, household income, 
and the number of educational resources. By using Elastic Net regression, the authors were 
able to understand which of the socioeconomic factors relates most to student GPA. 
From Shamsuddin et al.’s 2020 work entitled "Support Vector Regression for Predicting 
Student Performance", it was established that SVR suits well for studying intricate 
relationships between students’ backgrounds , income, and the outcomes of their education. 
The findings emphasized the need for complex modeling strategies in deconstructing the 
various avenues over which socioeconomics affect academic success. 
According to Akinyemi et al. (2019), “Decision Tree Approach for Predicting Student 
Performance” article, Decision Tree Regression is capable of indicating strong hierarchical 
relations between socioeconomic and academic performance. He mentioned the fact that 
Decision Tree Regression will allow visualization of the socioeconomic impact on academic 
decisions, thus simplifying the interpretation for stakeholders. Through analyzing this 
approach, scientists found important points in socioeconomic variables that greatly 
influenced students’ academic progress. 
In “A Random Forest Approach to Predicting Student Performance”, Li et al. (2021) 
examined how Random Forest Regression can effectively model and interpret the interaction 
of the socio economic factors and the Performance. Their study showed that Random Forest 
is a good fit for analyzing socio economic information with the influence of a variety of 
interrelated factors. The outcomes showed that Random Forest Regression exceeded basic 
modeling when determining how socioeconomic factors interplay to inform educational 
advantages for diverse student groups and as disadvantages. 
Socioeconomic determinants of academic achievement through different Data Science 
methods are part of the advancement of our analysis of educational equity at NUST being 
precise, in terms of determinants for factors of influence on academic achievement, but in 
depth. Understanding these determinants is necessary so that one can design interventions 
and support mechanisms which will be able to accommodate students from various 
socioeconomic statuses. The comparison of regression method performances indicates the 
necessity for careful consideration of models for proper interpretation of the broad-based 
impact of socioeconomic status in attaining success for students. 
Incorporating such findings prescribes our analysis techniques in order to permit a wide range 
of socioeconomic factors, such as household earnings, parental educational achievement, 
environmental factors, and availability of educational facilities. Comprehensive search of the 
literature is required for proposing measures that would guarantee equity among NUST 
students and enhance learning outcomes. In addition, most importantly, it is essential to 
become more familiar with the most effective practices in predicting socioeconomic effects 
in order to develop proactive assistance around students. 
This specific study will close gaps by specifically analyzing the influence of socioeconomic 
dimensions on academic achievement at NUST using cutting-edge data science methods. By 
using descriptive and predictive analysis combined with machine learning models adapted 
for NUST's heterogeneous student body, this study hopes to contribute actionable evidence 
to educators, HR personnel, and student affairs departments to promote academic equity 
and student success across socioeconomic lines.
